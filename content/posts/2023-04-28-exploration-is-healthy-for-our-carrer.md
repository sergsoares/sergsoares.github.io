As a SRE today and as expected as someone with limited resources, time and capabilities I work with a fraction of technology tools today.

Most part of tools and services that help me achieve my end results that is enabling dev teams to delivery more and better and allow whatever already was delivered working well.

It can include products like AWS, azure, k8s, datadog and tools like terraform , cloudformation, typescript.

But sometimes is good break that comfort zone and explore topics that of course aren't part of my daily job and career study like ChatGPT and AI models.
