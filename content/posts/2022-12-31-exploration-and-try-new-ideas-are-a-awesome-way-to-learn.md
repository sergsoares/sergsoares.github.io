Looking at Hacker news, i saw a post call my attention.

[I rewrote in Crystal my tool to quickly create Kubernetes clusters in Hetzner](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34185209)

And it called my attention for several factors:

1. Create tooling that envolve K8S.

3. Using a not too mainstream language (Crystal).

5. A useful use case inside a real cloud vendor (Hetzner).

I liked the insights that it give for me and the execution plan from the author, a lot of details need to be managed for the tool work.

The app use too configuration file, and take care of Idempotency (the main problema normally) and the update and delete operations for the created infrastructure.

Inspiring see that type of project
