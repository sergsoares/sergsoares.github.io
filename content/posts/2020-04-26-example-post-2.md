Keep an personal blog is common in IT but beyond expose yourself to others and increase your visibility it improve our write skills, tecnical learning and help others with tips/insights.

In a past i already try write with frequency but fall in the side-project trap:


The main points to avoid fall in this trap again:

- Keep blog simple and focus in content
- Small and simple posts to gain cadency
- Talk about work insights and problems solved

Trying again this habit, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static generator really fast made in [Go](https://golang.org/) and starting from [Minimal template](https://themes.gohugo.io/etch/) created by [Lukas Joswiak](https://lukasjoswiak.com/).
